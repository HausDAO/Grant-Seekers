## Notes from BitDAO Docs

### What kind of projects will BitDAO provide grants to? Why would BitDAO do this?**

BitDAO may look to provide grants for development of decentralized technologies including DeFI, governance, layer 1 or layer 2 , privacy, NFTs, etc. We may also provide grants for contributors to BitDAO, for example building a **custom governance module**, or efforts in community management, or the future BitDAO foundation.

### How will BitDAO treasury grow over time?**

BitDAO will look to token swap with existing and emerging projects, and support them to be category winners. By holding partner project tokens, BitDAO is incentivized to help our partners succeed. BitDAO will also look to build useful products that can contribute back to BitDAO treasury. Read more at: [growth](https://docs.bitdao.io/#growth)
